## Website for Small Business that makes Sweet Potato Pies.

### Languages used:
* HTML
* CSS
* JS

### Design Details: 
I wanted to show off my design skills with this project. I was able to complete the color palette by using colors associated with a sweet potato pie and
provided a fund but readable font that would also bring more flavor to the design. I also created all the graphics used. I originally used a lot of CSS styling tricks 
for the logo header but came across sizing and positioning difficulties when switching to mobile view so I created the graphic in Canva to make it easier. 
I created a mockup of what I wanted originally but when I am working on the project I get new ideas and build on that and make it better.
