## Website for Small Business that makes Sweet Potato Pies.

### Languages used:
* HTML
* CSS
* JS

### Design Details: 
With this project, I wanted to showcase my eye for design, using an analogous color scheme associated with colors from the sweet potato pie. The company itself did not have a branding
logo, so I designed one. I attempted to use my CSS positioning skills to originally design the logo, but based on having to account for the webpage size changing its position, I then decided that the logo needed to be designed elsewhere and then placed on the website.
